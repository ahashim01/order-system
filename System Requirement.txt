1. The system should support inserting various JSON schemas for different store types (e.g., 'Salla', 'Zid', 'Shopify', etc.) and store them as models in the database. Refer to the `.json/` folder for examples of Salla and Zid schemas.  
2. The system must provide functionality to update existing orders as required.  
3. The system should facilitate the easy integration of new JSON schemas for parsing orders from additional store types.  
4. The system must effectively handle race conditions, so we dont end up with 2 customers of the same store type and custom id.
5. The `stores_webhooks` view should ensure response times do not exceed 5 seconds.  
6. The system must successfully pass all tests in the `test.py` file without errors.  
7. All orders should be accurately saved in the database.
